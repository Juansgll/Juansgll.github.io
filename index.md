San Francisco is a prominent city on the western coast of the United States, known for its cultural significance and economic vitality. Its landmarks, neighbourhoods, and history draw millions of visitors annually. However, beneath its appealing exterior, the city faces many challenges related to crime.  

The Golden Gate Bridge, with its imposing presence along the bay, serves as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of crime within San Francisco. Much like the bridge connects disparate regions, crime threads its way through the city, touching various aspects of life for its inhabitants and visitors. Over time, the city has experienced fluctuations in criminal activity, with each period leaving a noticeable mark on the urban environment. Just as the bridge symbolizes unity, crime underscores the complex web of social dynamics present within the city. 

Analysing crime rates is complex and requires a comprehensive approach of the policies and law reinforcements developed, poverty, homelessness and immigration, among other reasons. Durin the 2000s, tech companies started to establish in San Francisco, creating opportunities and wealthiness among some part of the population, but also causing gentrification and a social inequality among other side of the population due to the uprising prices of housing which led to an increase in homelessness and poverty. Other types of immigration also were attracted to the city, which also caused a shift in the types of crimes. Law enforcement strategies and priorities can influence the types of crimes that are emphasized in crime statistics. For example, increased police attention to specific offenses or neighbourhoods may lead to higher reported rates of those crimes, even if the underlying prevalence remains relatively stable. 

Since the topics of non-violent crimes, such as theft, vandalism, and drug-related offenses (like the fentanyl crisis)  are always on the news, but the worry of people in social media and from mouth to mouth is the increase in violent crimes in the last years, such as gun crimes, assault or robberies, the focus of this study is on this type of crimes that can affect peopleâ€™s integrity. The next figure shows the violent crimes committed in San Francisco from 2003 to 2018:

During the period from 2003 to 2018, two different Governors have overseen San Francisco: Gavin Newsom (2003-2011) and Ed Lee (2011-2017). In 2018, London Breed would be the successor of the position as governor. During their respective tenures as mayor of San Francisco Newsom and Lee had somewhat different approaches to fighting crime, reflecting shifts in policy priorities and community needs. 

Newsom's approach to addressing crime focused on tackling underlying social issues such as homelessness and drug addiction in San Francisco, prioritizing improvement in these areas. He implemented programs such as Care Not Cash, which aimed to reduce homelessness by providing supportive services instead of cash grants. He also supported efforts to reform the city's criminal justice system, including advocating for alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders and emphasizing rehabilitation and reintegration programs. However, during Newsom's tenure, there were also criticisms about his administration's handling of certain crime issues, particularly property crime and quality-of-life offenses in some neighbourhoods. 

Ed Lee continued some of the initiatives started by Newsom but also shifted focus towards community policing strategies and collaboration with law enforcement agencies to tackle violent crime. Lee worked on implementing policies aimed at enhancing public safety, such as expanding community-based policing programs, increasing police presence in high-crime areas, and investing in technology to improve crime prevention and response. Under Lee's leadership, there was also a focus on addressing the underlying social and economic factors contributing to crime, including poverty, lack of affordable housing, and disparities in access to education and employment opportunities. 

Although different approaches have been put into action, it can be observed in figure 2 that through the years there is not a clear tendency in crimes, but more of a fluctuation. It is important to remember that the total number of crimes shown does not represent the truth, since in statistics there are many things that can influence the data gathered, such as an upgrade in technology, more cameras throughout the city, focus of police in specific type of crimes and so on. In 2018 data is obtained until May, so the bar is not comparable to the past years.

It can be observed in figure 2 that assault is the most committed crime, and it shows no clear recession or growth pattern, but the fluctuation mentioned before. But forcible sex offenses and weapon laws are starting to show a growth tendency, which can be explained by the arguments mentioned before: more crimes are committed, but also more attention to these crimes is garnered. Robberies and arson remain constant throughout the years. Finally, kidnapping presented a peak from 2011 to 2015, but the next years present a considerable reduction. 

Furthermore, these crimes are often associated with the insecurity prevalent during nighttime in cities, where the lack of police presence and inadequate lighting can lead to a surge in such offenses.

However, violent crimes in San Francisco don't seem to discriminate based on time of day, except for the late hours of the night. These crimes are distributed almost evenly between 9 and 2 am. 

  

While this might seem like a relief, it's not, as if these crimes were solely associated with nightlife, a citizen leading a peaceful life could feel reassured about not getting involved in an unfortunate situation. However, the reality is different, where insecurity persists throughout the entire day.
